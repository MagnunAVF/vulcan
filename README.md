#  Vulcan - Forging The Edge

Vulcan is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development and deployment of JavaScript applications and frameworks. This powerful utility automates polyfills for Edge Computing, significantly simplifying the process of creating Workers, particularly for the Azion platform. 

One of the key highlights of Vulcan is its ability to establish an intuitive and efficient protocol for facilitating the creation of presets. This makes customization and adaptation to specific project needs even more accessible, providing developers with the necessary flexibility to optimize their applications effectively and efficiently.
